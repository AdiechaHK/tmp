It has hundreds of sport climbing routes as well as bouldering. <a href=\"http://www.magicmountain.de/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.magicmountain.de/</a> and apparently a gym and sauna!</p> <p>The cost is based on how many hours you climb for around 4 hours so the entry would be 15EUR (or 12 for students). You can also rent climbing shoes, harnesses and belay devices if you don't have them. I'll be arriving around 4:00pm and I'll wait outside for about 10 minutes. My friend designed some nice Meetup posters so it will be easy to find us if you want to come later.Â </p> <p>We'll be mainly doing top-roping with the possibility of a bit of lead climbing if people bring ropes. If you're a beginner and you wouldn't be confidant belaying another climber, could you please post a comment or write me a message. That will help us make sure we have enough experienced climbers to belay everyone.</p>"

        "Description": "<p>The <b>International Quickstep</b> is the Roaring 20's \"happy child\" of several earlier dance forms, including the Foxtrot and Charleston, but it quickly evolved into its own style. Its light and fast footwork and upbeat music make it one of the most crowd-pleasing of the 5 International Standard dances to watch. But it's even better to dance it - and as it's seldom taught outside of competitive dance schools, here's your chance to learn it. We'll start from scratch and build on basics.</p> <p>To get a taste of Quickstep, below is one of the world's top professional ballroom couples, demonstrating a wide range of Quickstep figures (from basic to advanced), to the signature 2/4 timing of Quickstep music:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf6xj2q1jvw&amp;list=PLcL4Tjb7H5F_Y93nTgfKD4EMhy0O2DdON\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf6xj2q1jvw&amp;list=PLcL4Tjb7H5F_Y93nTgfKD4EMhy0O2DdON</a></p> <p>\n\n\nWe'll teach a handful of the <b>fundamental Quickstep figures</b>, and how to combine them. You'll also learn some technique (from competitive ballroom dance) to make you look good. :)</p> <p>You can come <b>alone</b> (we'll change partners often) <b>or with a partner,</b> though in the latter case we do ask that both people register on Meetup â an accurate attendee count helps us organize things. Other info:</p> <p>â¢Â <b>Attendance policy</b>: Like Woody Allen said, 80% of life is just showing up. We have an attendance policy because: 1) we have limited space; 2) a dance class is highly participatory and each person's attendance matters; 3) because we give everyone individual attention; and 4) because theÂ organizers bear financial riskÂ in paying for the studio up-front. Thus,Â <b>if you flake/no-show, or cancel within 24 hours before the event, it will be noted</b>, with a warning. <b>If you no-show twice, you'll be permanently banned</b> from the group. So honor your RSVP, and we can all focus on dancing - instead of wondering who will show up. Thanks.</p> <p>â¢Â <b>The fee</b> covers the cost of renting the dance room, and this time, is payable at the door.</p> <p>â¢Â <b>Wear clothes comfortableÂ to move in</b>. Please note: <b>street shoes are NOT allowed</b> on the studio floor, so bringÂ dance shoes, or if you don't have any yet, wear socks you're OK to dance in - your feet will need to slide on the floor.</p> <p>â¢Â AlsoÂ <b>bring drinks/snacks to keep yourself going</b> and/or to share - it's not a heavy workout, but more than a walk - and a lot more fun.</p> <p>Please remember: like any other physical activity, you participate at your own risk, and your RSVP is acceptance of that responsibility. Thanks and we look forward to seeing everyone!</p>"
