        "Description": "<p><img src=\"http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/8/b/f/600_439466815.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Magic Mountain is a huge climbing center in Wedding. It has hundreds of sport climbing routes as well as bouldering. <a href=\"http://www.magicmountain.de/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.magicmountain.de/</a> and apparently a gym and sauna!</p> <p>The cost is based on how many hours you climb for around 4 hours so the entry would be 15EUR (or 12 for students). You can also rent climbing shoes, harnesses and belay devices if you don't have them. I'll be arriving around 4:00pm and I'll wait outside for about 10 minutes. My friend designed some nice Meetup posters so it will be easy to find us if you want to come later.Â </p> <p>We'll be mainly doing top-roping with the possibility of a bit of lead climbing if people bring ropes. If you're a beginner and you wouldn't be confidant belaying another climber, could you please post a comment or write me a message. That will help us make sure we have enough experienced climbers to belay everyone.</p>"

Let's have fun!</p> <p>You can check out our list of songs in the group discussion forum and add suggestions:<br/><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/de/Jazzpicnic-an-experiment-im-volkspark/messages/boards/thread/49080191\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/de/Jazzpicnic-an-experiment-im-volkspark/messages/boards/thread/49080191\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/de/Jazzpicnic-an-experiment-im-volkspark/messages/boards/thread/49080191</a></a></p> <p><br/>Bring along some drinks and a snack, and maybe some nice picnic blankets ;)Â </p> <p>We will provide:</p> <p>- some sheet music and backing tracks, but bring along your own if you have any.<br/>- a mic for vocals<br/>- a music stand<br/>- small percussion, shakers andÂ tambourine</p> <p>**Â <b><i>Only</i>Â <i>musicians</i>Â </b>should sign up but they can <b>bring</b> <b>friends</b> along of course **</p> <p><b>How to find us:</b></p> <p>We meet at the entrance of Hasenheide Park opposite Graefestrasse.

On the right hand side at a crossroad you will find the space.</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/1/3/d/3/600_438245075.jpeg\" /></p>"
